app-term-kit
============

Unifying a bunch of things I do in various CL apps mainly so I can throw some code away. You might find it useful, but probably moreso after I'm motivated to write docs for it.

Installation
------------

```bash
npm install app-term-kit
```

Usage
-----

```js
var app = new CLApp('app-name', {
    copyright : 'Ed Beggler',
    copystart : '2020',
    defaults : `{
  // This file was autogenerated by app-name
  //
  "name": "robble-rauser",
  "type": "*",
  "debug": false
}`
});
```

```js
app.command();
```

```js
app.argument();
```

```js
app.help();
```

```js
app.header();
```

```js
app.footer();
```

```js
app.plugins();
```

```js
app.useable();
```

```js
app.config();
```

```js
app.run();
```
